# BikeSharing
Using Tableau to analyze bikeshare data in NYC.

## Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to project whether or not a bike rental company could work in a different city. To be more detailed I went over all the key factors in Citibikes rental business and used tableau in the creation of charts and graphs to understand it better. 

## Results:
Usings Tableau I created 7 different visulizations using the total numer of trips, types of users, trip duration, and other demographics. Here's what I found:
1. Most useres tend to rent the bikes out for no longer than half an hour. 
2. Males have more checkouts and slightly longer trip durations.
3. It appears that weekdays have most rentals before and after work, implying that people use these bikes to get to and from work. 
4. Male subscribers on Thursdays are the most frequent riders. 
5. Younger folks have a longer average trip.

## Summary
After the visualizations I realized that a bike rental company's success is determined off of how much it gets used. The uses come in the form of getting to and from work as well as joy rides on the weekend. To make sure that there is no shortage of riders, the location needs to have a few things. A decent year round temperature, a young population, and lastly a short distance from work and home settings or a beautiful scenic route to take with the bikes. Without those things you could be looking at losses for a new startup company.
